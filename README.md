This web app tests how much of a cat lover one truly is. Only the best will be able to answer all the questions present. Worry not if you are not yet one. By the time you cycle through these phenomenal cat facts you are sure to fall in love with them too.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

  - Generic cards are colored green
  - Niche cards are colored yellow

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- A random card is generated from the list of avaliable cards
* One thing that I added to my flashcards web app was making it so if the user clicks on the back button then the next button they are taken back to the card they were viewing to make the flashcards more practical. Once the use makes it to the last new card they saw a new random card will be drawn
